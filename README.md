To clone the repository, click the green code button on the main repository screen, and copy the HTTPS link.
Open gitbash in the folder you would like to have the repository contents located.
Within gitbash, type "git clone" and then paste the link that you copied in step 1. 
Then hit enter in gitbash and it should begin loading the files.
Once the content has been copied to your project folder of choice, create another folder within that project folder called "Build"
Open CMAKE and select the project folder for the first location it asks for, and the build folder for the second location.
From here you may now hit "Configure" and wait for it to finish the configuration, which will likely result in it showing 2 errors.
Simply hit "Configure" again and they will no longer be shown as errors. 
You may now hit "Generate" and then "Open Project." 
Once you the Visual Studio space has loaded, on the right or left hand side you should see the solution explorer for the project.
Right click on the "Tactical_Turmoil" file that appears here and click "Set as Startup Project"
From here the code should be executable and you may play the game.
